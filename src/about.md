About Me

Hi, I'm Choi won-yong, a Data Engineer at Toss. I began my journey by leaving Busan Software Meister High School and later completed the Woowa Tech Course. I have a passion for problem-solving, innovation, and finding the right level of abstraction. Although I have much to learn, I'm dedicated to studying hard and growing this blog. I'm always open to coffee chats and discussions, so feel free to reach out!
